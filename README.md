# End to End Text Summarization

## Overview
End to End Text Summarization is a project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the extraction of key information from large amounts of text data. The project utilizes the Pegasus model for implementation, providing an effective and efficient solution for creating concise summaries of lengthy textual content.

## Why Text Summarization?

Processing vast amounts of text data manually can be time-consuming, and in many cases, it's not feasible to read through extensive documents to extract essential information. The End to End Text Summarization project addresses this challenge by reducing reading time and presenting a shortened version of the original text.

## Features
- Automated Summarization: The project offers an end-to-end solution for automated text summarization.
- NLP Techniques: Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including the Pegasus model, for effective summarization.
- CI/CD Pipeline: A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline ensures seamless automation, testing, and deployment of the summarization model.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment processes. The pipeline comprises the following steps:
Linting: Code linting ensures adherence to coding standards.
1. Unit Tests: Execute unit tests to validate the functionality of the summarization model.
2. Integration Tests: Verify the integration of the model with the overall system.
3. Deployment: Deploy the summarization model to a designated environment.

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically upon changes to the main branch.
